# ex_gnuplot, ex_util

 * interface for plotting stuff with gnuplot from C99 with Gnu Scientific Library
 * other utility functions and stuff.

`ex_gnuplot` is a fork of `gnuplot_i`, by N. Devillard (version 2.10, 2003).

Assumes gnuplot v. 4.6+ and GSL2.1+ but probably works on older versions  too (jut not tested).

## 'ex'?

I use these for my programming exercise answers during the on-going course 'Numerical Methods and C' here at UofH.

## License?
